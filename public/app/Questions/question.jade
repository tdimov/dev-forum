                    p I am creating a program to stabilize the video stream. At the moment, my program works based on the phase correlation algorithm. I'm calculating an offset between two images - base and current. Next I correct the current image according to the new coordinates. This program works, but the result is not satisfactory. The related links you may find that the treated video appears undesirable and shake the whole video is becoming worse.

                        p.text-size-14 What kind of videos are you targeting? Just artificial images (where the scene is in fact a plane) or real videos where pixels may be at different depth? And what movements do you want to correct? Smooth motions are mostly desired, but movements with a high accelerations are usually noise.
